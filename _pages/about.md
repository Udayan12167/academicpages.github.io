Hello! I'm Udayan Tandon, a 3rd Year Ph.D. Student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://cse.ucsd.edu/) at University of California, San Diego. I'm advised by [Dr. Lilly Irani](https://quote.ucsd.edu/lirani/) and am part of the [Feminist Labor Lab](https://feministlabor.ucsd.edu/), [Just Transitions Initiative](https://justtransitions.ucsd.edu/), and [The Design Lab](https://designlab.ucsd.edu/). I'm also co-advised by [Dr. Kristen Vaccaro](http://kvaccaro.com/).

# Background
I completed my Bachelors in Technology (B. Tech.) in Computer Science from [Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology](https://iiitd.ac.in/). I was a Research Fellow for 2 years at [Microsoft Research India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/) in the Technology for Emerging Markets (TEM) team (now called [Technology and Empowerment](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/theme/technology-and-empowerment/)). At TEM, I worked with [Dr. Jacki Oâ€™Neill](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/jaoneil/) and [Apurv Mehra](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/apmehra/) on developing a platform for financial inclusion. Before that for a while I was a core maintainer of an open-source software community called [coala](https://coala.io).
