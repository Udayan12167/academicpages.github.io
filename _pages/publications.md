## [Hostile Ecologies: Navigating the Barriers to Community-Led Innovation](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/6xj932f8)

*An alternative version of this paper titled "Barriers to community-led real utopias: A case study of taxis in San Diego" was presented at [The Beyster Symposium '22](https://smlr.rutgers.edu/BeysterProgram2022) and [Society for the Advancement of Socio-Economics '22](https://sase.org/event/2022-amsterdam/).

This paper describes how the contemporary technology innovation ecology is hostile to community-driven design. These hostilities are important to understand if we want to intervene in the policy landscape of technology innovation to support viable alternatives to big tech consolidation and more democratic ways of developing and maintaining technology. We contribute a thick description of the hostile ecologies faced by transportation workers, community organizers, and allied technology researchers as they work toward building a cooperatively-owned taxi business with a digital dispatching technology. Our findings show that the hostile innovation ecology manifests as constrained access to resources, an inequitable regulatory framework, diminished agency in the software design process, and limits to the will of our community partners. We discuss the paths toward innovation for United Taxi Workers San Diego as compared with transportation network companies (e.g. Lyft, Uber) in terms of access to funding, regulation, labor, expertise, and market. We argue that a critical examination of institutions and policies in the innovation ecology is a necessary step toward charting fair, equitable, and community-strengthening pathways for technology innovation in the future.
